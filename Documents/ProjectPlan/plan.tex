\section{Minimum Deliverables}
\subsection{Prepare existing codebase to be expanded upon and fix existing
    issues}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item (18 October) Convert source files to adhere to current coding
        conventions
    \item (18 October) Make use of .NET 4.5 features where applicable
    \item (18 October) Overhaul world generation system to require less
        repetition of code        
    \item (25 October) Test and fix ray tracing of a moving collision hull
    \end{itemize}
\subsection{Implement new pathfinding system and threat avoidance}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item (25 October) Place path vertices at significant positions within each
        block of the city for use when pathing between two nearby positions
    \item (8 November) Implement an abstracted higher level path finding system 
        for finding general paths between two remote locations, using the
        intersections of roads in the city as vertices
    \item (8 November) Allocate a limited amount of time for each agent to
        calculate paths per frame, and store the partial result to be continued
        next frame if required 
    \item (15 November) Add geometry \emph{hint} nodes to mark features of the
        world that can be exploited when agents are avoiding threats, for
        example hints for doorways and room corners
    \item (15 November) Rewrite agent threat avoidance to take into account
        geometry hints        
    \item (22 November) Test the new path finding system by instructing agents
        to path to randomly selected locations in the world
    \end{itemize}
\subsection{Analyse system scalability}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item (22 November) Evaluate frame time and memory allocated for a range of
        world sizes, from trivial to the largest possible
    \item (22 November) For each world size, record the above metrics for
        varying numbers of agents, from none to the limit that increases frame
        time to be larger than some target, with path finding disabled 
    \item (29 November) With some configuration of the above two parameters,
        experiment with the amount of time allocated for agents to find paths
        to analyse frame times
    \item (13 December) Experiment with limiting the range of agents path
        finding node exploration to currently or previously visible tiles, and
        then for currently occupied or previously occupied blocks, and compare
        performance and memory used
    \end{itemize}

\section{Intermediate Objectives}
\subsection{Improve and extend simulation environment}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item (29 November) Add mesh entity rendering component for entities with
        3D models
    \item (6 December) Implement barricade entities that block off a tile that
        may be destroyed if attacked enough
    \item (6 December) Add at least one decorative entity that will produce a
        resource (barricade material) when destroyed
    \item (13 December) Improve world generation to produce several building
        types with different layouts and that contain varying amounts of
        resource dropping decorative entities
    \end{itemize}
\subsection{Implement subsumptive agent AI architecture}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item (31 January) Build a wide variety of AI components to achieve
        different tasks or promote certain behaviours such as threat avoidance
        or exploration
    \item (31 January) Organise the AI components into layers of abstraction,
        where more abstracted layers may choose between the decisions made by
        the preceding less abstracted one, or override them
    \item (21 March) Compare survival rates and realism of different weightings
        for the subsumptive behaviour system, for example a configuration
        designed for flocking, and another where agents are solitary
    \end{itemize}
\subsection{Improve performance of path finding}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item (7 February) Implement path caching to improve path finding
        performance
    \item (7 February) Limit the capacity of the path cache, and remove
        infrequently used paths if this is exceeded
    \item (21 March) Investigate the resulting cache hit and fault rates for
        cached path discarding methods
    \end{itemize}

\section{Advanced Objectives}
\subsection{Expand user interaction with the simulation}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item (14 February) Add barricade material storage designations, and the
        ability for a player to place them
    \item (14 February) Include method for a player to order a specified group
        of agents to travel to a given location
    \item (21 February) Allow players to mark decorative entities that produce
        barricade material to be dismantled and scavenged from
    \item (21 February) Implement barricade building designations that may be
        placed by a player
    \item (21 February) Produce a method for players to toggle individual or
        groups of agents from being offensive or defensive
    \item (28 February) Create new AI components to complete the new user
        designated tasks
    \end{itemize}
\subsection{Implement a BDI architecture for comparison}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item (7 March) Construct an alternative agent AI architecture using a
        beliefs-desires-intentions model to perform the same tasks as the
        existing subsumptive one
    \item (14 March) Attempt to build a rudimentary planning system on top of
        the new BDI oriented architecture to improve agent performance
    \item (21 March) Compare the two architectures in terms of memory usage,
        frame times, behaviour and survival rates for a variety of different
        initial simulation states
    \item (21 March) Assess the efficiency at which each architecture completes 
        user assigned tasks in similar circumstances
    \end{itemize}
